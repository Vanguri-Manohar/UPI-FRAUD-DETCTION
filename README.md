 With the increasing use of digital payments, fraud detection has become a crucial 
challenge in financial security. This project focuses on UPI fraud detection using 
machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. The model is 
trained on a dataset containing various transaction details, including timestamps, 
transaction amounts, categories, and user details. The system evaluates multiple machine 
learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision 
Trees, and Random Forest, before implementing a Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN) for enhanced accuracy. The Random Forest approach achieves a high accuracy of 
nearly 100%,outperforming traditional fraud detection methods. The system provides 
real-time fraud alerts, enhancing security in UPI transactions by preventing unauthorized 
transactions and reducing financial losses. This approach improves fraud detection 
accuracy, ensures user privacy, and offers a scalable solution for secure online payments.
